Screenshots coming soon!

[Try a sandbox version here!](https://play.dhis2.org/2.35.0/api/apps/custom-report-builder/index.html#/tables)

This is a DHIS2 app designed to provide table-building functionality with some tools that are currently unavailable to existing pivot tables, including:

- Adding predefined text to cells
- Highlighting cells based on value
- Querying different data items for every cell
- Having control over the exact contents of every cell, for example querying a different indicator or program indicator in every cell

Read the Instructions for Use [on this page](https://github.com/KaiVandivier/custom-report-builder/blob/master/docs/tables.md).

This app is built using DHIS development tools, including:

- The app runtime data layer
- The app service datastore
- Complex form validation using final form
- Extensive use of the UI libraries
- Data and period selector components from the analytics library

An alpha version for testing is awaiting approval on the DHIS App Hub.
